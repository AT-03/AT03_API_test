======================== Practice #3 =================================

1. Let’s consider you are in a new team :
Define which code guideline you would suggest for :
* Format (int, float, string)
R.- For the correct use of the variables (int, float, string) it would be advisable to use the syntax using (to_)
 according to the type of variable to be used, to be able to distinguish the variables according to their type and that
 there are no errors at the time of executing the Script eg:

    variable = get.chomp.to_i
    variable = get.chomp.to_f

* Classes
R.- The correct use of classes is to follow the editor's syntax, eg:
    def name_class
     ---------
    end

* Methods
R.- For correct use of methods it is advisable to make use of parentheses (), since a good IDE programming environment,
  advises using parentheses like "Jetbrains RubyMine", eg:

    def method (name)
     ----------
    end

* Variables, Getter/Setter
R.- Make use of the module attributes to simplify code lines, eg:

    Attr_reader: name
    Attr_writer: name
    Attr_accessor: name

* If condition
R.- Make use of short-if expression, to simplify code lines and make use of the advantages that Ruby offers when using
  the code editor, eg:

    result = (name)? True: false
