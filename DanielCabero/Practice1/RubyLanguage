1.-Whats is ruby
    Ruby is an open source, interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto.
    Who chose the gemstone's name to suggest "a jewel of a language."

    Ruby is designed to be simple, complete, extensible, and portable.

    The Ruby programming language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and is named after the birthstone of one his colleagues.
    Interestingly, the pearl (as in the Perl language) is the June gemstone, while ruby is the July gemstone.
    This makes the subtle suggestion that Ruby is a step forward from Perl.

    The syntax is very basic and it is completely object-oriented.
    This means every type of data handled by the language is treated as an object, even data types as simple as integers.

    Ruby is open source and freely available for both development and deployment.

    The fisrt level is the implement the unit test in develop fase, it is the embrace the higher test.
    The second level is API test for testing with the data under the application, see the atributes.
