 Lets consider you are  in a new team
 -define which code guideline you would suggest for:
    Format(int, float, string)
        the variables format is for the initialize is
        with vocal in lower case for the write easily and fast.
        Example
            int number,
            String name,

    Classes
        the classes should be with correct format in the name and vocal in up case,
        methods names clear and with comments clear and precise of the actionof the method.

                class Number, class Example

    Variables, Getters Setters
        the variables should be clear
        the getters and setters should be
         precise and comments that objects be get or  the change of attributes

                number = 25,
                getNumber(),


    If condition
        the if conditional should be the minor cantidad for not miss the class coverage and
        not miss time in implemented unit test for cover the coverage.

        the sintax should be clear and precise not have two or
        more conditions in the head of the if condition.

        if(condition1)          if(condition1 condition2 condition3)
        correct                     no correct
