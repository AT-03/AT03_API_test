Letâ€™s consider you are in a new team :
Define which code guideline you would suggest for :

1. Format (int, float, string)
The best way to use the format for the type of valiables are the following:
 Example for Integer

 String word = "Test"
 int number = word.to_i

 Example for String

 int number = 1234
 String word = number.to_s  // or we can use .to_str

 Example for Float

 String word = "word"
 float f = word.to_f


2.Classes

The classes we can use the classes for default


3. Methods

For the methods we can use with parenthesis

Example
          def test(test1,test2)

          end

4. Variables, Getter/Setter

For the variable getter and setter we can use the following:

attr_reader :item_name
attr_writer :item_name

Because is better and more understand

5. If condition

For the condicion we can use in one line like:

result = (condition) ? (expression-if-true) : (expression-if-false)
